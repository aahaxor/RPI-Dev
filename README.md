# RPI-Dev
This is a basic HTML frontend for a WebIOPi backend server with REST API enabled.
If you don't know what WebIOPI is, WebIOPI is a server framework for the Raspberry Pi and other linux machines that lets you control GPIO pins from the web. This basic site uses HTML5 Voice Recognition to allow you to use voice commands on top of GPIO features, which for me lets me turn the lamp in my room off and on by just saying "Computer, turn the lamp on.". I hope that you find this useful!

# Install
To install WebIOPi, I have a repo set up at https://github.com/aaroexxt/RPIInstaller that automatically downloads, installs, and sets up WebIOPi for the RPI. If you don't want to use my automatic package, there are many tutorials online that will be of much help :)
Simply move the contents of this repository into the doc-root of your webiopi installation.

# GPIO
I have the lamp relay (I'm using a Powerswitch Tail II) attached to RPI pin 23 and the LED to pin 18.
